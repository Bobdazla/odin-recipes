        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Garlic bread consists of bread, often a baguette or sour dough like a ciabatta, which is spread with a mixture of butter and fresh garlic before being baked or broiled. Variants may include additional ingredients like cheese, herbs, or olive oil. The bread is then either grilled or broiled until toasted and the garlic flavor is pronounced, creating a savory, fragrant side dish or appetizer. Perfect for pairing with pasta dishes, soups, or salads, garlic bread is beloved for its crispy texture and buttery garlic flavor.
