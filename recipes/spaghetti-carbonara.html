        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Spaghetti Carbonara is a classic Italian pasta dish from Rome, made with egg, hard cheese (typically Pecorino Romano or Parmigiano-Reggiano), pancetta, and pepper. The dish arrives at a creamy consistency without using cream, as the eggs are cooked gently by the heat of the pasta to form a rich, velvety sauce. It's a simple yet indulgent dish known for its comforting flavors and quick preparation time, making it a favorite for both weeknight dinners and special occasions.
